### Exercises from Semester as a Bioinformatics Student

In this section, I explore various programming paradigms that I have worked with during my studies in bioinformatics:

- **Imperative Programming** – Python  
  - Focused on solving bioinformatics problems step-by-step, manipulating data structures directly.
  
- **Functional Programming** – Scala  
  - Emphasized immutability, higher-order functions, and functional constructs for clean and efficient code.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Scala  
  - Applied OOP principles like classes and inheritance to organize bioinformatics data processing tasks.

These exercises aim to deepen my understanding of how different programming paradigms can be applied to bioinformatics challenges.
